# About Me
*My name is Sinjin Cho-Tupua. I'm a junior majoring in 6-3 and minoring in both music technology and math. I'm from Hawai'i, so I love warm weather, the beach, and hiking. I enjoy beach activities such as diving, paddling, and surfing. Indoors, you'll find me playing video games (league of legends, minecraft, etc.) or making food with my family.*
