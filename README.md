# Template Portfolio
This will be your portfolio repository. Use this as a [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) and customize it to your own tastes. We gave you a starting point with a space to describe yourself and a link to where your assignment 1 file can be.

# About Me
*My name is Sinjin Cho-Tupua. I'm a junior majoring in 6-3 and minoring in both music technology and math. I'm from Hawai'i, so I love warm weather, the beach, and hiking. I enjoy beach activities such as diving, paddling, and surfing. Indoors, you'll find me playing video games (league of legends, minecraft, etc.) or making food with my family.*
