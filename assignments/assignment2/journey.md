# User Journey
[back to table of contents](/assignments/assignment2/contents.md)

Pikachu just finished drafting his first ever piece of music, an ambitious piece that utilizes a full symphony orchestra. Pikachu wants to get feedback to improve this piece so that it not only sounds good but also feels good to play. However, his friends only play string instruments, and he doesn't know any woodwind, brass, or percussion players.

Pikachu as a result goes to Reverb with the goal of getting diverse, easily parseable feedback on his brass, wind, and percussion parts so that he can later go on to iterate on his piece.

Once logging in, Pikachu finds himself on the Home Page. Pikachu clicks on the + button under his music to navigate to the Upload Page. Pikachu titles his piece and gives a description, saying that this is his first ever full composition and that he wants it to be a fun, joyful-sounding piece. Under the description, Pikachu adds the tags: woodwind, brass, percussion. Pikachu doesn't have a recording of his piece, but he uploads a pdf of the score on the right side. He designates his piece as public so that he can get as many suggestions as possible. He clicks post to let others see his work

*A few days later*

Pikachu logs back onto Reverb and checks his home page. He clicks on his composition which is in his music list. On the View Page, he looks to the bottom right to take a look at any comments that others left. He can see a dozen comments. For most of the comments, he sees the woodwind, brass, or percussion tags. The comments are mostly positive. However, he also sees tags like "difficult" and "awkward" specifically paired with the brass tag. This lets Pikachu know that he needs to take a deeper look at his brass parts when reworking his composition. He is glad that he was able to determine what he needs to work on on these parts that he is less familiar with.


### Note
I was unsure if I should add a separate user journey for a user that was giving feedback, because they don't necessarily have the same problem as the Composer stakeholder. I could have included it in Pikachu's journey since giving feedback to others is also a way to improve ones own skills, but it would have ended up being too long.
