- Below the search bar will be an area where their own work will be available to view. It will display the title of the piece and a small render of the sheet music. Clicking on one of their existing pieces will navigate them to the View Music page.
- At the end of their music list, they will have a + button to navigate to an Upload page to upload their music for feedback.

**All pages feature a navbar on the lefthand side that has buttons to redirect to home page, profile, etc.**
