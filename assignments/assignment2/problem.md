# Problem Statement

## Domain
### Musician
I began playing the piano when I was 8 and I picked up the viola when I was 12. I played in my school orchestra and for the Hawaii Youth Symphony. I currently play for MIT Video Game Orchestra. I've also recently gotten into arranging/composing music, though I am quite novice. I believe that music is a great way to make connections with others and I've met a lot of long time friends through music. I also find it to be a breath of fresh air compared to my normal college studies.

## Problem
### Music Composition Feedback
A major problem in the domain of music making (specifically music writing), is that it can be hard to get streamlined feedback. One of the key parts of composing music is getting peer feedback on your work. However, finding people to get feedback from can be troublesome for beginner composers and a barrier to them further exploring this aspect of music. It can be uncomfortable for someone with a low confidence in their work to directly go up to someone and ask them to take a look at it. They might also not even get the type of feedback they are looking for and end up learning nothing.

## Stakeholders

1. **The Composer** is the person seeking to improve their work through peer feedback but who doesn't have good methods of doing so.

2. **Commenters** are those who are willing to give feedback to other composers.

3. **Novice Composers** are a subset of the Composers who are newer to composing music and may particularly have a hard time getting feedback due to lack of confidence, knowledge, or connections.

4. **Instrumentalists** are those who may play the music made by the Composers

5. **Music Audiences** are those who listen to the music made by the Composers

This article talks about how important it is to get feedback in music production. It talks about how the process of receiving feedback should be very thorough with examples such as identifying the emotional journey and messages of the music.

2. [Benefits to feedback beyond better music](https://www.edmprod.com/5-tips-gathering-feedback/#:~:text=Music%20feedback%20gives%20you%20new,but%20also%20to%20enhance%20it.). This article mentions how there are more benefits to feedback than fixing errors or making that one piece better. It explains that getting feedback can help with getting new ideas, identifying weak spots, and building a network with others.

3. [Not many applications specifically designed for music feedback](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-an-online-community-of-composers-where-I-can-go-to-get-feedback-on-my-work). This Quora post highlights the fact that there isn't really an application specifically designed for giving musical feedback. Most people including myself resort to traditional mediums of communication to share/comment on music

4. [Groover. Getting music heard by curators](https://groover.co/en/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=how_to_get_feedback_on_my_music_bandzoogle_en). Groover is a website that allows users to submit their music and send it to curators for feedback and promoting your music. However, this is blocked behind a paywall, and you aren't necessarily guaranteed to get good feedback (or any at all).

5. [Most websites think about large scale artists](https://bandzoogle.com/blog/how-to-get-feedback-on-your-music). This article talks about how good it can be to get music feedback from fans or industry professionals. This shows that most people really don't consider smaller scale artists like college student groups for example who want to get feedback on arrangements.

6. [Giving good feedback makes you a better composer](https://www.ascap.com/news-events/articles/2017/07/giving-better-song-feedback). This website gives many good tips for giving feedback to others' musical work. However, the biggest thing that they mention is that giving feedback to others also helps you improve as well.

7. [Recieving bad, non-streamlined feedback is detrimental](https://blog.tonicaudio.com/music-feedback/#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20just%20playing,ll%20receive%20more%20specific%20answers.). This article talks about the negative effects that other's feedback can have on musical work. It is important to streamline what exactly it is you want feedback about and how to give that feedback.

8. [Quality of feedback based less on musicality than creativity](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1407/AInF2015paper4.pdf). This is a very interesting research paper that studied the effects of feedback on musical composiitons. The results were that composers who recieved feedback were able to improve their songs. More interestingly, it showed that music composition background didn't have much effect on the quality of feedback, suggesting that creativity is a more important quality than musicality.

9. [Soundcheck. A Music Feedback website](https://soundbetter.com/products/soundcheck). This website allows users to select credible musicians to give feedback on music. However, it is a paid feature and once again, the composer doesn't have much control over the kind of feedback they get.

10. [There are problems with getting feedback through online communities](https://musicreviewworld.com/get-feedback-on-your-music/). This article goes into a lot of the music review process. It namely lists many pros and cons of using online communities or forums for feedback. The main issue with these is that they contain a lot of noise and aren't specifically targetted for composition feedback.
