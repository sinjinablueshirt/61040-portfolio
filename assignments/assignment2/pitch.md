# Application Pitch

### Name: Reverb
### Motivation:
Many musical composers, especially new ones, struggle in getting reliable, streamlined feedback on their work.

### Features:
1. **Tailored Feedback Request** - When composers upload their work, they can include a description that can add context to their piece such as explaining what it is being used for or who its intended audience is. They can also specify what kind of feedback they want (dynamics, chord distribution, etc.) and designate their piece as public or private. This allows them to easily put out their work and streamline the types of feedback they get. It also helps others find their work easier

2. **Feedback Type Search** - When users want to find pieces to give feedback to, they can search for pieces where the composer was looking for specific types of feedback such as "dynamics" or "chord distribution" in order to find things that they are interested in or good at. This helps the commenters by making it easier to find things that they want to give feedback on. It also helps the composer get feedback that is more tailored and reliable.

3. **Categorizing Feedback** - When users give feedback, they can designate their suggestions according to a category of feedback such as "tempo" as well as reference certain sections of the piece. This helps the original composer organize and act on feedback based on its type in a streamlined, clear fashion. It also makes it easy to see what concepts/sections the composer needs to work on generally at a glance.
