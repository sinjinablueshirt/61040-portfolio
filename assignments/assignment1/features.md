### Overpicking Lei Materials
1. **Tree Recording/Searching:** Users can record locations of specific trees that they've been to. They can search for trees to learn about location, native/endangered status, or any other useful information. This will also help make sure they are acting in accordance wiht law and general etiquite.

2. **Resource Report:** After picking, the user can report how much they took from the tree & how "full" the tree is so other users can stay updated on it. It will also help them keep track of how much more they may need to pick to make their lei.

3. **Picking Recommendation** Users can get a suggested amount of flowers that they should pick from a tree. This will help users make their way towards making the lei as well as keeping the tree in a good condition for the rest of the community to enjoy.

### Staying Safe While Paddleboarding/Surfing
1. **Safety Report**: When looking at a location, users will be able to identify different statistics that will help them make informed decisions about going out onto the water. Weather conditions, surf report, presence of wildlife, rip currents, crowd estimations with a map to show dangerous zones on the shoreline.

2. **Connecting**: Users will be able to connect with other users. This adds to safety because when going out onto the water, there is safety in numbers and having other people know generally where you are. They can help in the case that you get injured or lost.

3. **Recent News**: Users will be able to see recent news stories surrounding the locations. This will help them infer what to expect in terms of unexpected crowds or any potential hazards.

### Music Composition Feedback
1. **Tailored Feedback Request**: When composers upload their work, they can include the sheet music and sound. They can also specify what kind of feedback they want or ask for help on specific sections. They can also include context to their piece such as explaining what it is being used for or who its intended audience is.

2. **Collaborator Selection**: When composers upload their work, they can designate who they'd like to be able to give feedback on it. They could make it available to all users or just to a select few in order to streamline the feedback process to their needs.

3. **Feedback Tags**: When users want to give feedback, they can search for pieces using tags that might be like "dynamics help" or "chord distribution help" in order to find things that they are interested or good at. Additionally, when users give feedback, they can label the feedback with a tag to help the composer organize and act on feedback.
