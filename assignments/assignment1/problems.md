## Problems

```
Points with a * in front of them are the ones I selected for further consideration
```

### Lei Making
1. ***Overpicking Lei Materials**: I chose this problem because one of the biggest issues with lei making is when people overpick from neighborhood trees either out of not knowing how much they need or not knowing where to find other trees. It is really bad for the fragile island environment and makes lei making harder for others who rely on such resources. As a result, it is important for small scale lei makers to responsibly gather their materials. Title: Overpicking Lei Materials

2. **Knowing how to use some flower/material to make a lei**: I didn't choose this one because it would be very complicated due to how many different lei materials and techniques there are. The amount of combinations would make it super difficult to develop an app. I also think that the technique of lei making is something that people often learn from others, and learning them from am app would take away its value.

3. **Identifying flowers**: I didn't choose this one because though new lei makers might want to be able to identify flowers, I think it would not be useful enough to warrant making a whole application. There are also helpful guides online to identifying flowers and plants.

### Paddleboarding/Surfing
1. **Finding good beaches**: I chose not to include this one because it seems like something that wouldn't be used very much since people often use word of mouth to know what beaches to go to. It also might have unforeseen negative effects such as overpopulating the already popular beaches

2. ***Staying safe on the water**: I chose this one because there are just so many different things to think about when going out on the water. Things like wave height/intensity, sealife, and crowds are important to consider. It is also important to not go out on your own. Currently, there are websites that track only one of these things, but none exist that combine all of them. This is especially important for tourists who may not be familiar with beaches and conditions. Title: Staying Safe While Paddleboarding/Surfing

3. **Knowing how far you paddled**: I chose not to include this one because I think it would be very difficult to use. Maybe it would be OK for people who paddle close to shore, but going out deeper makes it harder to keep track of where you've been.

### Musician
1. ***Music Composition Feedback**: I chose this problem because one of the most important parts of making music is getting feedback from others, much like many other fields. However, sometimes, it may be awkward or difficult to go up to people and ask them to give you feedback. Additionally, asking multiple people is bound to give a bit of unwanted feedback. Fixing this issue can help novice composers build confidence in asking others for feedback and also help them write better music. Title: Music Composition Feedback

2. **Transcribing Music**: I didn't choose this problem because many methods already exist for transcribing music into different clefs or rewriting them for different instruments. Additionally, it doesn't seem like that big of a problem. If someone was really dedicated, they could learn how to read the music in a different clef or just transcribe it on their own.

3. **Finding a Music Group to play with**: Though I think this would be a good problem to solve, I think it would also be accomplished through normal communication or socializing means. I think it is also something that is a broader problem than "finding music groups" and more of a situation of "finding confidence to approach people", which I think is beyond software capabilities.
