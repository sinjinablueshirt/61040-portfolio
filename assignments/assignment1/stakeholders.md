### Overpicking Lei Materials
1. Artist - The person picking flowers/materials for lei making
1. Lei Makers - All other Lei Makers
2. Newbies - Those who are new to or want to start making lei
3. Hawaiians - Native Hawaiians
4. Locals - Those who live in Hawaii
5. Tourists - Those who visit Hawaii
6. Companies - Larger companies who commercially make/sell lei
7. Native/Endemic Plants - Plants that are native to Hawai'i or can only be found in Hawai'i
8. Endangered Plants - Plants that are recognized by the state as being at risk of extinction
9. Lei Making Trees - Any plant that is used to make lei

**Impact**: Artist and Newbies benefit by having knowledge of where to find flowers/materials in their neighborhoods. Other Lei Makers also benefit since they are more likely to have more flowers available at more locations. Hawaiians will benefit since it will be easier to maintain the survival of at-risk species that might be key aspects of their culture. Locals and tourists alike will be able to enjoy trees having flowers on them and not being barren. Locals who might use flowers/material for things other than lei will have more resources to do so. However, Locals may have issues if people begin picking flowers on their property. Companies who commercially make lei may grow discontent since more people will be encouraged to make their own lei. Native, Endemic, and Endangered plants will benefit by having a system to better manage the island's resources. Additionally, any plant in general that is used to make a lei will benefit by not having all of its flowers, nuts, fruit, leaves taken at once.

### Staying Safe While Paddleboarding/Surfing
1. Watergoer - The person going paddling/surfing who interacts with the app
2. Beachgoers - Other people at the beach
3. Lifegaurds - The ones in charge of safety at the beach
4. First Responders - Police, Firefighters, EMTs, etc. who might respond to a call for help
5. Other Watergoers - People who might be in the same area
6. Businesses - Businesses near beaches (resturaunts, stores, etc.)
7. Sealife - Turtles, sharks, seals, fish, jellyfish, etc. that often live on the shorelines

**Impact**: The Watergoer and Other Watergoers will benefit by being more safe and knowledgeable of their surroundings. They both will be able to know who is nearby and build connections with them to maintain mutual "safety in numbers". Beachgoers will potentially see less people on boards and will thus be more safe and happy due to the extra space. Lifeguards will be more free to attend to other Beachgoers. First Responders will be more free to attend to other incidents in other places. Businesses that set up shop near very crowded beaches may see less customers and thus suffer. Protected Sealife such as turtles or seals will benefit by those being aware of their existence. The Watergoers will also benefit from knowing if there are any Sealife that may present a threat such as jellyfish and sharks.

### Music Composition Feedback
1. The Composer - The person who wants to write music
2. Commenters - those who give advice to the Composer
3. Musicians - Those who may play the composer's piece
4. Audience - Those who may listen/watch the performance of the Composer's piece
5. Novice Composers - a subset of Composers that is newer or less experienced

**Impact**: The Composer will benefit by being able to easily ask others for feedback on their piece. This will not only make the process faster, but will also make it easier to work with because they can streamline the kind of feedback they're looking for. Commenters, who may also be other Composers or Musicians, will benefit by having a method by which to easily give feedback to others. Commenters will also improve their music writing by giving others feedback. They will typically be those with some sort of pre-existing connections to the Composer (same school, same club, distant acquaintance). Musicians specifically will be able to play pieces that won't need to be changed as much between rehearsals. Audience members will have an enjoyable experience listening to a music piece that has been reviewed by many people. Novice Composers especially benefit from this sort of system because they can pick up essential composition skills as well as build connections while finding those to give advice on their work.
