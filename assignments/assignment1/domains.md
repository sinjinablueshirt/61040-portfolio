```
Points with a * in front of them are the ones I selected for further consideration
```

1. **Environmental Volunteering**: beach cleanups, invasive species removal, large scale projects such as fishpond restoration

2. **Pokemon Cards**: collecting cards, playing the game, trading with friends

3. **Hawaiian Food**: cooking with my family, socializing with extended family, introducing others to culture

4. **Late Night Beach Exploring**: Running around on beach grabbing crabs at night, wading around in tide pools looking at cool sea life

5. **Rock/Coral/Shell Collecting**: Identifying and collecting rocks, coral, and shells.

6. **Sleeping** huge advocate for sleep, will sleep rather than cram for an exam, like to track my sleep patterns to make sure I am always well rested

7. **Hiking**: hikes in Hawaii, taking pictures in nature, exploring new areas with brother, hanging out far from the city

8. ***Lei Making**: I've been making lei for most of my life, and they're a very big part of the local culture of Hawai'i. I mostly learned it from various family members over the years. I find lei making to be quite fun because after walking around the neighborhood picking flowers from random trees, I can just sit down and get all "artsy". However, I do think that this art form can be hard to pick up because identifying flowers/materials can be difficult and knowing what to do with them is even more so. Also, if we aren't careful, it can lead to environmental damage.

9. ***Paddleboarding/Surfing**: I picked up stand-up paddleboarding and surfing just before COVID hit. My favorite times to go are at dawn and dusk because the atmosphere is super calming and surreal. It's my favorite weekend activity to do with my family. However, it can be dangerous or not fun if one chooses the wrong beach to go to and is unaware of potential threats. Knowing how much somone paddles is also hard for when they might want to keep track of exercise data.

10. ***Musician**: I began playing the piano when I was 8 and I picked up the viola when I was 12. I played in my school orchestra and for the Hawaii Youth Symphony. I currently play for MIT Video Game Orchestra. I've also recently gotten into arranging/composing music. I've met a lot of long time friends through music but am nervous about getting help on music compositions. I also like playing fun pieces I find online, but they are often in a different clef, which is more annoying. I also wish I could become more comfortable playing with completely random people.
